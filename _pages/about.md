I am a second-year PhD student at <a href="https://sites.usc.edu/eessc/" target="_blank">EESSC</a> lab in the <a href="https://viterbischool.usc.edu/" target="_blank">Viterbi School of Engineering</a> of the <a href="https://www.usc.edu/" target="_blank">University of Southern California</a> advised by <a href="https://viterbi.usc.edu/directory/faculty/Beerel/Peter" target="_blank">Prof. Peter Beerel</a>. My research interests lie in the field of Efficient Artificial Intelligence. Currently, my recent works involve spiking neural network, state space models and efficient fine-tuning of large language models.
